# QA Report

To run QA, raise a QA issue to document the process as a [QA Report issue](https://github.com/pietrop/slate-transcript-editor/issues/new?assignees=&labels=QA%20Report&template=qa_report.md&title=[QA]%20Main%20check%20list), it will have the checklist below and you can run through it and check each item as you follow the steps.

If you run into issues with any of the individual items, raise a separate issue for each as a [QA Report - individual issue](https://github.com/pietrop/slate-transcript-editor/issues/new?assignees=&labels=QA%20Issue&template=qa_individual_issue_report.md&title=[QA]%20Issue%20#1.1%20Can%20edit%20the%0text). Write a note of the item numnber, and "title" in the issue title and description
